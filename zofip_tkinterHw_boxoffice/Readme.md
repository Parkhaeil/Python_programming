This is the "zeze's restaurant" menu ordering program I created with Python's tkinter library. When a user puts his/her brain out and places an order, it is designed to guide the user in the right direction.

The interesting thing about my program is that birthday discounts are available. When the orderer's birthday is entered, a 10% birthday discount is applied when it matches the computer time.
